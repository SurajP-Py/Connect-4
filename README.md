# Connect-4 
<h2>About This Project:</h2> 
This project was made in my Junior Year of high school during time off for Winter break. This was my first time using the PyGame module, but still only took a few hours to copmlete. To play, <a href="https://github.com/SurajP-Py/Connect-4/blob/main/Connect%204.exe">download the file</a> and run it. Then, simply press numbers 1 through 7 on your keyboard to place tokens on the grid. It will automatically alternate between red and yellow tokens and announce if either player has won. Press 0 to reset the game.
